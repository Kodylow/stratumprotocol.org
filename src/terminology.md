| Nonce                       | Abbreviation for “number only used once”; In Bitcoin, the nonce is a 32-bit-long value which is adjusted incrementally and used to rehash a hashed block until the hash output meets the current difficulty level restrictions of the network, signaling a valid solution has been found and the miner can then propose their block to the rest of the network.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| nTime rolling               | nTime is the integer timestamp (in seconds) included in the block header. NTime rolling is a way for miners to increase the timestamp locally in their hardware rather than requiring a new block header from their pool every single second, reducing the amount of data transfers that need to occur between pools and miners. An explicit nTime rolling value instructs miners how long they can increment nTime (in seconds) before they need to request new work (i.e. a new, valid block header to mine on) from the pool. |
| Pool Service (i.e. Server)  | Furthest upstream node, responsible for generating unique jobs for each connection to the server by putting unique data into the coinbase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
